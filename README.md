# XBOX 360 joystick converter/emulator/thingie for older PC's

This project was created from an idea Renaud Bedard had a while ago while rebuilding his 486 DOS PC.

Since USB Host chips have gone down in price, and using arduino as the glue, a MCP4231 chip was chosen to emulate a potentiometer.

Schematics and other details to come.... SOON
